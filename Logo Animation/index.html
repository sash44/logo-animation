            <h1>Logo Design</h1>
            <p>Hey Chichi! is a podcast targeted at young adults, giving listeners the lastest 
                gossip and dives into the shade of all celebrity juice. The podcast also serves as a advice/dilemma solver for anyone that sends in their issues and would like some honest advice and opinions. 
            The purpose of the logo is to grab the attention of new listeners with the initial pop up of the crown, as ChiChi prides on making sure all users feel like kings/queens when listening for advice. The Hey ChiChi, acts as a call out as any interaction with a listener always start with 'Hey ChiChi', representing the brand and the host. 
            Following 'Whats the tea?' is the slogan that represents what the listeners would be asking the host when they think of what the podcast offers, meaning 'whats the lastest news'.  </p>
            <p>The logo is a simple, elegant and straight to the point, there is no major images, crazy animation that take away from the what the brand requires. Its the brand name, the slogan with a small crown. It's made with a div tag as the container where the logo sits in and the actual logo in two span tags and an img tag. The top/crown and bottom text roll in one at a time and gives the shout out feel. 
                The animation used is a translate, that brings the first text/crown up first, followed by the bottom text. The top text size is slightly bigger set at 15vmin and colour #a6bbe2, animation duration at 3s, giving the users enough time to read the brand name. The bottom text is set as 9vmin and colour #e9e7c7 and animation duration also at 3s. 
                Both spans have animation delays of 2 and 1.75seconds and the whole animation at a infinite transition. Throughout the content page a colour coordination is demonstrated, the theme of pastel blue and yellow//white are kept throughout to stay true to the brand colours. As well as the colour chosen against the dark background being suitable for all users with visual impairements or colour issues.  </p>
